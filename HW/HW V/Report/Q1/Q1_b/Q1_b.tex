We design a lead controller with siso tool box.
$$
C(s) = \dfrac{16.231(s + 2.51)}{s + 6.963}
$$

System is stable with controller and have a noise cancelation for frequancy after $100_{rad/{\sec}}$ and it have effect on system about $-20_{dB}$. System have very good disturbance rejection about $1_{rad/{\sec}}$ and have a good disturbance rejection about $10_{rad/{\sec}}$ and disturbance have effect on system about $-5_{dB}$. 

In this question we don't know what is plant and actuator and how noise or disturbance effect on system and about what frequancy so we assume that noise is about more than $100_{rad/{\sec}}$ and disturbance is about $10_{rad/{\sec}}$ and$-5_{dB}$ is a low effect and system work well.

No. System have staedy state error. we could increase gain in controller but it needed very high gaib controller and no actuator can do this so we can't make staedy state error zero with this requirements.
